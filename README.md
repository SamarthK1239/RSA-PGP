# RSA-PGP
A system to create RSA and AES keys. You can also encode strings directly into RSA and encrypting AES keys works too.

If you want to create a slightly longer message, use the "AES.java" file.

Then Run the encryptText program and type in "AES KEY"

Then you can send the encodedText and encryptedText files to someone


The decryption process is:

Run the DecryptMessage program and it will give you the AES key

Now copy the key from the console and run the AESDecrypt program

Paste the key when prompted

You will obtain your message after a second or two

"Reusing a symmetric encryption is a cardinal sin of cryptography"
and so, don't forget to generate a new key every single time.
